Welcome to the Team Task Manager application

With this application you can manage tasks in a team whenever and wherever you are. 
The registration of projects and accounts can be done using the team task manager website.

With this app you can view and manage projects that were made online. You can add new tasks,
report a problem or edit existing tasks. A task must be given to a person that participates
in that project. 

Everyone that participates in a project can add a task, edit a task or report a problem.
